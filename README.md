# ETF_Analyzer

This ETF Analyzer utilizes data gathered from SQL databases to compare and analyze different  stocks within an ETF portfolio. Through the analysis of different parameters such as daily return values, cumuluative return values, and annualized return values, I was able to observe the performace of the portfolio. This analyzer is efficient because it supports passive investing. This way, you don’t spend time researching individual stocks or companies or take the risk of investing in a single stock. This ETF analyzer allows you to feel confident in the diversification of your portfolio.
